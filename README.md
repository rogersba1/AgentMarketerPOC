# Multi-Agent Marketing Campaign System

🎯 **Status**: ✅ **Hybrid Chat Interface with Advanced Agent Orchestration + New CampaignCompany Data Model**

A sophisticated demonstration system showcasing two complementary approaches to AI agent interaction: a simple, clean chat interface (inspired by Azure samples) that seamlessly connects to a powerful multi-agent orchestration engine, combining the best of both worlds for marketing campaign creation and execution.

## 🚀 **LATEST UPDATES (July 11, 2025)**

### ✅ **Major Data Model Restructuring Completed**
- **NEW**: `CampaignCompany` data model for organized per-company content storage
- **ENHANCED**: ResearcherAgent now handles company brief generation (moved from ContentGenerationTools)
- **IMPROVED**: RouterAgent with helper methods for better content organization
- **UPGRADED**: All services updated to work with new structured data approach

### 🎯 **Known Issues Being Resolved**
- **Company Brief Cards**: Display and approval workflow needs API endpoint updates for new data model
- **Frontend Integration**: Approval API endpoints need to be created/updated in SimpleChatController

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **⚡ Hybrid Approach - Simple Chat + Advanced Orchestration (Current Branch: AgenticWebAppSampleApproach)**
```bash
# Clone and switch to the hybrid approach branch
git clone <repository-url>
cd AgentMarketerPOC
git checkout AgenticWebAppSampleApproach

# Terminal 1: Start the Web API Backend (Advanced Agent Orchestration)
cd AgentMarketer.WebApi
dotnet run
# 🎯 API & Orchestration: https://localhost:7001

# Terminal 2: Start the Web Chat Interface (Clean UI)
cd AgentMarketer.Web  
dotnet run
# � Chat Interface: https://localhost:7002
```

### **🔧 Original Console Application (Main Branch)**
```bash
# Switch to main branch for console-based interaction
git checkout main

# Start console client for direct agent interaction
dotnet run --project AgentCmdClient
```

## 💬 How It Works

1. **🗣️ Natural Language Chat**: Describe your campaign goals using everyday language - no technical jargon required
2. **🤖 Intelligent Agents**: AI agents (Planner, Researcher, Content Generator) collaborate in real-time to understand and execute your vision  
3. **📊 Live Progress Updates**: Watch agents work with dynamic progress indicators and real-time status messages
4. **✅ Human-in-the-Loop**: Review and approve campaign plans with embedded interactive components in the chat
5. **🎯 Automated Content Generation**: AI creates personalized landing pages, emails, social posts, and advertisements for each target company
6. **🚀 Campaign Execution**: Launch campaigns with continuous monitoring and real-time status tracking
