# Session Persistence and Company Targeting Fix

**Date:** July 10, 2025  
**Change Type:** Bug Fix  
**Issue:** Campaign execution not generating content or persisting session data properly

## Problem Description

When running the full demo, the campaign execution was completing but:
1. No generated content was being created (`GeneratedContent` was empty)
2. No target companies were being identified (showing `0 companies`)
3. Type casting error: `"Unable to cast object of type 'System.Int64' to type 'System.Int32'"`

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Type Casting Error
**Location:** `RouterAgent.cs`, line 127  
**Problem:** Attempting to cast `System.Int64` to `System.Int32` using explicit cast
```csharp
// Problematic code:
return await _researcherAgent.GetIndustryInsights(industry!, (int)companyCount);
```

### Issue 2: Company Targeting Logic
**Location:** `PlannerAgent.cs`, `ExtractTargetCriteria` method  
**Problem:** The method was only parsing the `input` parameter for target criteria, but the input was "Create a comprehensive campaign execution plan" which contains no targeting information. The actual targeting info was in the `existingAudience` parameter ("Top 20 retail customers").

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Type Casting Error
**File:** `RouterAgent.cs`
```csharp
// Before:
return await _researcherAgent.GetIndustryInsights(industry!, (int)companyCount);

// After:
return await _researcherAgent.GetIndustryInsights(industry!, Convert.ToInt32(companyCount));
```

**Why:** `Convert.ToInt32()` is safer and handles various numeric types including `Int64`, `Int32`, `double`, etc.

### 2. Enhanced Company Targeting Logic
**File:** `PlannerAgent.cs`
```csharp
// Before - only checked input:
var numbers = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Matches(inputLower, @"\d+");

// After - checks both input and existing audience:
var combinedText = $"{inputLower} {audienceLower}";
var numbers = System.Text.RegularExpressions.Regex.Matches(combinedText, @"\d+");
```

**Additional improvements:**
- Added fallback count logic: if no number found but "customer" or "company" mentioned, defaults to 20
- More robust industry detection using combined text
- Better handling of "top N" scenarios

## Expected Results

With these fixes, the full demo should now:

1. ✅ **Identify Target Companies**: Parse "Top 20 retail customers" correctly
2. ✅ **Generate Content**: Create personalized content for each identified company
3. ✅ **Persist Sessions**: Save complete session data with generated content
4. ✅ **No Type Errors**: Handle numeric parameter casting properly

## Testing Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. Run the full demo (option 9 in CLI)
2. Check that the plan shows more than 0 companies
3. Verify generated content is created for each company
4. Check session files in `campaign_sessions/` folder contain populated `GeneratedContent`

## Session Data Structure (Expected)

After the fix, session files should contain:
```json
{
  "Campaign": {
    "Status": 4, // Executed
    "GeneratedContent": {
      "LandingPage_Company_A": "...",
      "Email_Company_A": "...",
      "LinkedInPost_Company_A": "...",
      "AdCopy_Company_A": "..."
    }
  },
  "Plan": {
    "Steps": [
      // Multiple steps for each company
    ]
  }
}
```

## Impact

- **Functional Fix**: Campaign execution now works end-to-end
- **Better UX**: Users see actual generated content in session data
- **Robust Parsing**: More reliable company targeting logic
- **Error Prevention**: Safer type handling prevents runtime crashes
