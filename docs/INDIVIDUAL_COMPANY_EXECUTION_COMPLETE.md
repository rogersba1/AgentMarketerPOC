# Individual Company Execution Implementation Complete

## Summary of Changes

We have successfully refactored the multi-agent marketing campaign orchestration system to execute campaigns individually for each target company, removing all generic content generation methods in favor of company-specific personalization.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **PlannerAgent Enhancements**
- **Individual Company Execution**: The `CreateExecutionPlan` method now creates separate execution steps for each target company
- **Company-Specific Steps**: Each company gets its own research, content generation, and review steps
- **Personalized Parameters**: All steps include company-specific data (name, profile, industry) for maximum personalization

### 2. **RouterAgent Updates**
- **Removed Generic Content Methods**: All legacy content generation functions (`GenerateLandingPage`, `GenerateEmailDraft`, etc.) have been removed
- **Company-Specific Execution**: Only personalized content generation functions are now supported:
  - `generate_personalized_landing_page`
  - `generate_personalized_email`
  - `generate_personalized_linkedin_post`
  - `generate_personalized_ad_copy`
  - `generate_personalized_content` (with smart fallbacks)
- **Enhanced Router Functions**: Added support for:
  - `ReviewCompanyCampaign`: Individual company campaign review
  - `CoordinateMultiCompanyCampaign`: Final coordination across all companies

### 3. **ContentGenerationTools Cleanup**
- **Removed Generic Methods**: Eliminated all non-personalized content generation methods
- **Company-Focused**: All content generation now requires company data for personalization
- **Smart Fallbacks**: When company data isn't found, the system creates basic personalized content using the company name

### 4. **Execution Flow**
The new execution flow for a campaign targeting 3 companies with 2 content types:

1. **Industry Research** (1 step) - Gather industry insights
2. **Individual Company Execution** (3 companies Ã— 4 steps = 12 steps):
   - For each company:
     - Research Company X
     - Generate Content Type 1 for Company X
     - Generate Content Type 2 for Company X  
     - Review Company X Campaign
3. **Final Coordination** (1 step) - Coordinate across all companies

**Total: 14 highly personalized steps** vs the previous 4 generic batch steps

## Benefits Achieved

## Technical Implementation
