## Expected Workflow

### Phase 1: Campaign Setup

2. Plan generated with company brief generation and review steps
3. System identifies target companies (e.g., "FashionForward", "TechCorp", "RetailPro")

### Phase 2: Brief Generation and Review
4. System generates detailed company briefs including:
   - Company overview and metrics
   - Campaign alignment analysis
   - Personalization strategy
   - Risk assessment
   - Success metrics and timeline

5. System pauses and requests human approval

### Phase 3: Human Review Process
6. Human reviews each brief for accuracy and strategy
7. Human can:
   - Approve as-is
   - Approve with modifications
   - Reject and request regeneration

### Phase 4: Content Generation
8. After approval, system continues with content generation
9. Creates personalized landing pages, emails, LinkedIn posts for approved companies
10. Campaign completes with all content generated

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Approve All Briefs

- Verify all content is generated

### Scenario 2: Modify Briefs
- Review briefs and provide modification feedback
- Continue execution
- Check that feedback is incorporated into execution log

### Scenario 3: Reject and Regenerate
- Reject a brief with specific feedback
- Note how the system handles rejection
- Test regeneration workflow

### Scenario 4: Mixed Approvals
- Approve some briefs, modify others, reject one
- Test that system handles mixed approval states correctly

## Verification Points

1. **Brief Quality**: Check that generated briefs contain relevant company information
2. **Pause Behavior**: Verify execution pauses at approval points
3. **State Persistence**: Confirm approvals are saved and persist across sessions
4. **Feedback Integration**: Check that human feedback is stored and logged
5. **Resume Functionality**: Verify campaign continues correctly after approvals
6. **Content Generation**: Confirm personalized content is generated only for approved companies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No active session"**: Start a new campaign first
2. **"Company brief not found"**: Execute the campaign to generate briefs first
3. **"Step not found"**: Ensure you're using the exact company name from the plan

### Debug Commands

- Use `list` to see all pending approvals
- Check campaign status with option `5` from main menu
- View generated content with option `7` from main menu

## Clean Up

To start fresh:
1. Exit the application
2. Delete the `campaign_sessions` folder
3. Restart the application

This removes all saved sessions and allows you to test the workflow from the beginning.
