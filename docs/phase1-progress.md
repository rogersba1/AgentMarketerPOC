### **Immediate Tasks**
1. Resolve any remaining build issues
2. Test parallel execution with multiple companies
3. Verify enhanced content generation works with real company data
4. Add content export functionality

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

1. **Run Full Demo** with multiple companies to verify parallel processing
2. **Check Session Files** to ensure enhanced content is saved properly
3. **Verify Progress Indicators** work during execution
4. **Test Error Handling** with invalid inputs
