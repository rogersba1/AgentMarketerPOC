# Individual Company Execution Test

This document demonstrates how the refactored system now executes campaigns individually for each target company.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Individual Company Execution in PlannerAgent**
- The `CreateExecutionPlan` method now creates separate execution steps for each company
- Each company gets its own research, content generation, and review steps
- No more batch processing - each company is handled individually

### 2. **Personalized Content Generation**
- `ContentGenerationTools` now supports company-specific content generation
- Each method takes company profile data for maximum personalization
- Content is stored with company-specific keys (e.g., "Email_CompanyName")

### 3. **Enhanced RouterAgent**
- Added support for new execution functions:
  - `GetCompanySpecificInsights`: Individual company research
  - `generate_personalized_*`: Company-specific content generation
  - `ReviewCompanyCampaign`: Individual company review
  - `CoordinateMultiCompanyCampaign`: Final coordination across all companies

## Sample Execution Flow

For a campaign targeting 3 retail companies with email and landing page components:

### Steps Generated:
1. **Industry Research** (1 step)
   - Gather retail industry insights

2. **Individual Company Execution** (3 companies Ã— 4 steps = 12 steps)
   - For each company:
     - Research Company X
     - Generate Email for Company X  
     - Generate Landing Page for Company X
     - Review Company X Campaign

3. **Final Coordination** (1 step)
   - Coordinate across all companies

### Total: 14 personalized steps vs previous 4 batch steps

## Benefits of Individual Execution

1. **Maximum Personalization**: Each company gets content tailored specifically to their profile
2. **Better Quality Control**: Individual review and approval for each company
3. **Flexible Deployment**: Can deploy to companies individually or coordinate launches
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add more companies or modify individual campaigns
5. **Detailed Tracking**: Per-company execution status and results

## Mock Data Integration

The system now uses comprehensive mock data for 20 companies (10 retail, 10 manufacturing) with:
- Detailed company profiles
- Industry-specific insights
- Business metrics and leadership info
- Digital presence and market positioning

This enables highly personalized content generation that references specific company details.
